Hi! üëã This is my daily learning log. In today's world, learning often happens through conversations with AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. I'm structuring these learnings into tutorials and diagrams to make them more insightful and reusable.

## Some Background

I think keeping complete html pages as one tutorial will give lot of freedom.  Markdown files, also good, for each tutorial.  But html will bring lot of interactivity and innovation while leaning any concept. When AI is generaing what we ask, learning becomes more important.  

## What's Inside

- **Tutorials** - Structured guides from my AI learning sessions
- **Diagrams** - Visual explanations of complex concepts

## Latest Learnings

- [HTML Tags: Code to Reality](tutorials/html-tags/index.html) - HTML elements and visual layouts
- [Model Context Protocol](tutorials/model-context/index.html) - LLM interaction patterns

## Topics I'm Exploring

- AI-Based Developer Workflows
- Latest AI Developments in Software Engineering
- Relearning Software Concepts with AI
  - Either while Teaching Programming to my Kids
  - Or General Revisiting Core Concepts

## How to Use

1. Browse tutorials in the `tutorials/` directory
2. View diagrams directly on GitHub
3. Use these examples in your own learning journey
